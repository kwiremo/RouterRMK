/**
 * The Routing Record Class extends the TableRecordClass.  It adds supports for the unique demands
 * of the routing table. The record will contain a NetworkDistance pair object, an Integer
 * containing the LL3P address of the next hop to this remote network, and finally a unique key
 * generated from the rest of the record. The Key will be a combination of the next hop
 * (source of the information) and the remote network.  Mathematically speaking we take advantage
 * of the fact that the max LL3P address has a two byte value of 255 or less.  Thus if we  multiply
 * the network number times 256*256 and add the next Hop weâ€™ll have a unique key for every route that
 * could be placed in the table. Note that multiplying 256*256 shifts a hex number to the left by a
 * byte. So multiplying it by 256 ^ 2 will shift it to the left by 2 bytes. As a result, a key will
 * be a good way to visualize the network number and the next hop in the key. For example, if we
 * have the network number 03 and next hop 0x401, the key will be 0x040103.
